Let me say something; Most of the peoples does not know about our platform. I want tell something about this

1. Quantaex is not an ordinary platform which not built on readymade fixed script.
2. In back end 5 full scale server works.
    + MySQL
    + Redis
    + RabbitMQ
    + Peatio
    + Barong

3. These 5 servers are extremely powerful and most advance for such platform like QuantaEx. All servers are most current versions.
Others servers are.
	+ Control Tower
	+ 4 Coin Nodes
	+ Monitor

Besides all these 18 daemons are all time non-stop running. We need [used] <b>2 64GB 16-core 1TB server and one 8-core 32GB, 1.5TB server</b>. We have much capacity. But you my dear community need to understand to currectly running this types of system  takes how many days.

My assistant developer <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/imjaireddy">JK</a>  is now grown up. He is scalling user UI/UX design very nicely. I am <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitbd83">TR (CEO of QuantaEx)</a> still developing more. Because we want to make it <b>No#1 in quality</b>.

I believe without a quality <i><b>"Katana"</b></i> you will not win, when how qualified <i><b>"Samurai"</b></i> are you is not matter. You need a good <i><b>"Blade"</b></i>.
We finished!! Pray for us

Thanks for your support!
